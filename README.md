Sup there, AverageDood here. Or Avera, for shorts.

- Not a lot about me. She/her, LG{BT}, regular everyday gal, interested in some tech-y things, mostly related to Steam, Android, and Linux.
- Also videogames. Lots of them. From Celeste and Stardew Valley, all the way to the likes of Sparking Zero and Touhou Project.
- Not interested in Apple. Actually, not interested on even hearing it's name. No Apple here.

Always looking for some small talk, of any kind. If you want, you can hit me up at Discord (Average_Dood_) or at the [Fediverse](https://verse.averagedood.xyz)

Avera out.
