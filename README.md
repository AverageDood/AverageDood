Sup there, AverageDood here.
Not a lot about me. Regular everyday guy, interested in some tech-y things, mostly related to Windows, Android, and to some extent, Linux.
Also videogames (someone out there who gifts me a GPU or a Steam Deck, pls, I do good dick sucking)
Not interested in Apple. Actually, not interested on even hearing it's name lol.
Currently deciding with which lenguage should I start learning programming and coding. Idk, maybe Python?
Modded Baddar90's and ArrowOS's Samsung Exynos 9810 device trees (only what goes on device/samsung path) to make some kind of template for it. Also modded with an ignore neverallows tag, seems like it's needed rn on Android 12.

Always looking for some small talk, of any kind. If you want, you can hit me up at https://t.me/AverageDood
Also if you're looking for gaming partner (which is... not really a thing you come into GitHub to search, but I'm no one to judge lol) just know I don't play CoD, Fortnite, any Riot Games titles or Blizzard titles. Also no console exclusives, I don't own consoles.

AverageDood out.
